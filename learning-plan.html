  <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
  <p class="home-body">My current long term goal is to become a software developer at the end of this course and work my way towards being a Senior Web Developer in 10 years. As a Senior Developer I can manage and train my own team of Junior Developers. With my design skills this seems like the obvious direction for my career in tech however I believe this experience with Dev Academy will open me up to other pathways.</p>
  
  <h2>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>
  <p class="home-body">My strengths are my determination and patience when it comes to learning new things.</p>
  
  <h2>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
  <p class="home-body">I’d like to develop my team skills in reaching out for help when I need it. Sometimes I struggle reaching out for help as I sometimes feel shame for being helped and feel I need to do it on my own. I’d like to develop a skill to reach out more to the great people here at Dev Academy.</p>
  
  <h2>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.  </h2>
  <p class="home-body">To keep myself productive I have used a Pomodoro Timer to work focussed for 60 minute sessions and then a 5 minute break in between. It’s been quite affective for me so far and gives me time to focus on all aspects of my work including my interactions with other learners and facilitators. 

    When things begin to build up I will contact our team facilitator as soon as possible as the sooner I reach out the better it will be. 
    
    I expect the Facilitation team to be supportive and encouraging as they’ve all been already. To support us when able and to guide us in the right direction. 
    
    I have daycare drop offs at 7:30 am in the morning and 5:15pm in the evening. From the evening to 9pm is time spent helping with my son with his night routine.
