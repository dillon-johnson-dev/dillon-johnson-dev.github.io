  <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
  <p class="home-body">
    My current long term goal is to become a software developer at 
    the end of this course and work my way towards being a Senior Web Developer in 10 years. 
    As a Senior Developer I can manage and train my own team of Junior Developers. With my 
    design skills this seems like the obvious direction for my career in tech however I believe 
    this experience with Dev Academy will open me up to other pathways.
  </p>
  
  <h2>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>
  <p class="home-body">My strengths are my determination and patience when it comes to learning new things.</p>
  
  <h2>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
  <p class="home-body">
    I’d like to develop my team skills in reaching out for help when I need it. Sometimes I 
    struggle reaching out for help as I sometimes feel shame for being helped and feel I need to do it on my own. 
    I’d like to develop a skill to reach out more to the great people here at Dev Academy.
  </p>
  
  <h2>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.  </h2>
  <p class="home-body">
    To keep myself productive I have used a Pomodoro Timer to work focussed for 60 minute sessions 
    and then a 5 minute break in between. It’s been quite affective for me so far and gives me time to focus on all 
    aspects of my work including my interactions with other learners and facilitators. 
    
    When things begin to build up I will contact our team facilitator as soon as possible as the sooner I reach out 
    the better it will be. 
    
    I expect the Facilitation team to be supportive and encouraging as they’ve all been already. To support us when 
    able and to guide us in the right direction. 
    
    I have daycare drop offs at 7:30 am in the morning and 5:15pm in the evening. From the evening to 9pm is time 
    spent helping with my son with his night routine.

  <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
  <p class="home-body">
    I was really hoping I would get into website development following my time at Dev Academy. I've spent alot of time 
    designing websites in my career and working alongside developers to get the outcome we are looking for. I hope that 
    I would be able to combine those design skills with my newly attained developing skills and build beautiful websites
    for clients and also work with them on a design level too.
  </p>
  
  
  <h2>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h2>
  <p class="home-body">
    I think my biggest strength may be my eagerness to working in paired sessions. I've always loved working in groups
    and hope I can be a good person to work alongside. I think my limitations will be on my java knowledge but I am 
    hoping to ease that through the usage of studying up during this final week of foundations.
  </p>
  
  <h2>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h2>
  <p class="home-body">
    Probably my biggest thing would be to be able to keep on top of the workload. I got sick in these last two weeks
    and its really thrown me in a spiral keeping on top of everything. Im worried getting sick again in bootcamp
    would be intense to try and recover and stay on top of things. 
  </p>
  
  <h2>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
  <p class="home-body">
    I would really love to be able to develop in leadership skills. I'd love to be able to one day lead a team or give 
    back like Dev Academy and be a leader/teacher to those wanting to learn and be in this industry. 
  </p>
  
  <h2>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h2>
  <p class="home-body">
    Being available far more for support than they have been in the foundations course. Granted they've been extroadinary
    in foundations, at times it felt hard to get a hold of help when so many of us were dealing with trouble in our
    learning and code. 
  </p>
  
  <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h2>
  <p class="home-body">
    To seek help immediately when I am needing it. Asking for help has had to be a practice and one I want to utilise
    during bootcamp. I will also commit myself to making a list at the end of every night of what I learnt in the day 
    and what I had trouble learning. This way I can reach out more and focus on my learning process.
