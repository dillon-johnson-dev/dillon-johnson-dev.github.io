    <h1 class="intro-h1">Problem Solving</h1>
    <hr class="solid">
    <h2>Was there a time you were blocked on a simple problem?</h2>
    <p class="home-body">
      Yes, there were a few times I would be blocked on my objects and arrays. Remembering how to use my dot notations correctly.
      My first problem-solving method was to take a step away from the screen for a few moments. Knowing that it was something
      I've done before I knew my block could be approached with less stress after clearing my mind first. I felt challenged but 
      not overwhelmed this time around. I learned alot around my problem solving skills and ability to work towards a solution.
    </p>

    <h2>When did you elegantly solve a problem</h2>
    <p class="home-body">
      When I was working on the fizzbuzz if statements I felt like the understanding of the code was flowing through my mind
      so fluidly and easily. Admittedly I was stumped at first but I used rubber ducky and reading my error messages to help
      solve the problem bit by bit. I felt confident knowing I was going to solve the problem and that the information from 
      my memory would flood in with the new researched information. Through this experience I was able to learn the multiple 
      ways if statements can be used and familirialising myself with writing the statements. 
    </p>
  
    <h2>How confident do you feel on each of these problem-solving techniques/processes?</h2>
    <h3>Pseudocode</h3>
    <p class="home-body">
     I feel fairly confident using this method. It does make the complex problems seem way smaller once I begin the process
     of breaking the code down into fine easy steps. 
    </p>
<hr class="solid">

    <h3>Trying something</h3>
    <p class="home-body">
     I've begun to utilise this method more, especially at the start of the problem as it helps me write down parts of the answer
     I don't know and pinpoint exactly what I am needing to know to find the answer.
    </p>
<hr class="solid">

    <h3>Rubber ducky method</h3>
    <p class="home-body">
     This felt a little weird to do at first. However after doing it writing my code became much clearer than before. I would find
     myself doing this method during and after the process of writing my code. This definietly gives me better understanding of what
     I'm writing and how I answer the problems. 
    </p>
    <hr class="solid">
    
    <h3>Console.logging</h3>
    <p class="home-body">
     To be honest I don't find myself using this method as much as I should. I tend to focus more on the other methods and sometimes use
     console logging to view what I've put in. 
    </p>
  <hr class="solid">
  
    <h3>Googling</h3>
    <p class="home-body">
     In my experience Googling is like second nature to my learning process. Anytime I've ever been stuck I've Googled to find the
     answer and to understand it. I am quite confident in this process as well as seeing how helpful it is to understanding lines
     of code. 
    </p>
    <hr class="solid">
    
    <h3>Asking your peers for help</h3>
    <p class="home-body">
     This was quite easy to do as everyone see's each other as team members and we're all willing to give out a supporting hand 
     when in need. I think we've all found a community in each other so I find asking my peers for help fairly easy. 
    </p>
    <hr class="solid">
    
    <h3>Asking your coaches for help</h3>
    <p class="home-body">
     Similar to my answer above, this has become quiete an easy task as our coaches have shown their eagerness and willingness to help
     and support us through the process. 
    </p>
    <hr class="solid">
    
    <h3>Improving your process with reflection</h3>
    <p class="home-body">
     I find this extremely refreshing when reaching at the end of a task or sprint. It helps me process what I've just gone through as 
     well as honestly reflect on my learning process and identify where I want to improve. 
    </p>
    <hr class="solid">
    
    <h3>Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. What made you reluctant to do so?</h3>
    <p class="home-body">
     Early on during my first two sprints I did find myself reluctant on asking for help. I think I felt a lot of imposter syndrome and
     reaching out for help felt like exposing myself as if I were a fraud. This felling changed the more I asked for help and the more
     reflection I done in realising all of us are in the same boat and some of us are at different levels at certain tasks. Thats okay
     and not at all a reflection of my ability.
