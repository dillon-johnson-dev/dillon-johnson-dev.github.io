    <h2>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h2>
    <p class="home-body">
      The three things I have learnt about muself and ego are that I have too much pride when it comes to 
      solving problems on my own. Often I hold myself back from asking for help because my pride tells
      me that I can solve the problem without help. However this course has helped me change that. The second
      thing I learned about myself is my ability to reset myself when I am feeling overwhelmed or intense pressure.
      The last thing I learnt was imposter syndrome was a big problem for me. And during this time I've had to 
      overcome that and accept my abilities and knowledge for where they are and no where I want them to be.
      Things take time, and time has certainly proved that it all comes together in the end. Few weeks ago I would
      not have thought I'd be able to work through the javascript exercises as I have this week.

    <h2>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
    <p class="home-body">
      They certainly play a huge part of how we treat ourselves during the process of learning. It becomes overwhelming
      very fast and being able to treat ourselves kindly and with empathy, we remind ourselves that we are only human
      and that we will eventually get it. Maybe not now or tomorrow but it will click and make sense. These values also
      are important when we begin working with others in teams and also being a support when someone needs.

    <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
    <p class="home-body">
      I think what has surprised me the most about our core learnings are during the pairing moments, how considerate and
      kind alot of the people in this course are. I think we all have a shared desire to do well and accomplish our goals
      through coding, but the pair and looping moments have also shined a light on everyones desire to help one another.
      That to me has been the most surprising but also encourganing thing to experience during this time.

    <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
    <p class="home-body">
      I guess the daily practice of being honest with ourselves and then sharing that through our blogs. Being transparent
      can be frightening but I've learned that this is a safe community to do this in. 
    </p>

    <h2>
      Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core 
      learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
    </h2>
    <p class="home-body">
      Not at all. I think its been valuable to us as individuals and to be consciously aware of how we treat others around us.
      In any Industry we have to work alongside or with people and our ability to treat them with kindness and empathy will 
      go a long way.

    <h2>
      Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that 
      time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
    </h2>
    <p class="home-body">
      I think the core learning has been fundemental to our learning process of ourselve but also the necessary break
      from our coding that we would need also. I often felt when I stepped away from my coding a little bit that my mind 
      felt refreshed and able to solve the problem I was having. Sometimes the core learnings felt like the needed break
      from the code that helped me process all the information and also retain it. I've also been able to learn alot 
      about myself and been given an opportunity to grow personally and in my ability to treat people better.
