<p class="home-body">
  Hi everyone, my name is Dillon Johnson. I was born in South Africa, 
  Cape Town and moved to New Zealand with my family when I was 10 years old. I’ve lived 
  here now for almost 20 years and in that time I have studied at Unitec for my bachelors 
  degree in Graphic Design and Animation, gotten married and have a 1 year old son.
  I decided that I wanted to study further through Dev Academy because I’ve always had 
  a deep interest and desire to pursue coding. Seeing what Dev Academy offered I took 
  a chance on myself and give the tech industry a chance. These last two weeks have 
  shown me that it is where I want to be and the career path that is right for me.
