          <p class="p-project">
            For my Piano Pitches team project, we decided on building an interactive
            piano that contained the voices and comments of members of our cohort.
            The intention was to create an app that commemorated our time
            with our cohort and to stretch our creativity and abilities. <br><br> My contributions
            to this app were assisting in the building of the database, creating the piano to
            hold audio files, CSS, and testing our code. On top of
            this, I also was the team's scrum facilitator and acted as the 
            team lead by allocating tickets to each team member based on our 
            planning and individual learning objectives. Each morning I would 
            hold a catch-up and check in on where people were, where they struggled, 
            and what they would work on next. With this, I would also provide a plan of 
            attack for the day to assist in our end goal in deployment.

          <p class="p-project">
            Recognizing the need to sharpen my React skills, I embarked on the creation of 
            a feature-rich todo list application. This application is designed to proficiently 
            manage tasks, offering core functionalities such as task listing, completion 
            tracking through a simple click, task editing, and seamless deletion. To enhance 
            the user experience, I incorporated Font Awesome icons, which elegantly serve as 
            intuitive controls for editing and deleting tasks. The journey of crafting this 
            application was an exhilarating blend of enjoyment and challenge. 
            <br><br> 
            The development process, particularly the implementation of task addition and 
            display mechanisms, posed significant challenges that proved instrumental in 
            accelerating my learning curve. Tackling these hurdles enabled me to fortify 
            and refine my React expertise, thereby invigorating my proficiency in the 
            technology. An interesting facet of this project was my creative integration 
            of CSS colors inspired by my fondness for the manga series "Naruto," infusing a 
            touch of personalization into the visual aesthetics.

            The technologies employed for this project include JavaScript, React, CSS, and HTML.
